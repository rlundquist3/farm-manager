# Insect Farm Manager

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/rlundquist3/farm-manager/tree/dev.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/rlundquist3/farm-manager/tree/dev)

This app (name TBD) is intended to help cricket farmers easily keep track of their inputs and yields to give them better insight into their stock and improve their efficiency. The underlying components are of course adaptable, and the app can be updated for use with other insects and even other crops.

------------------

## Data Tracked
The app can be used to track (this includes hard numbers and production/input per area for efficiency measures):

* population
* insects harvested
* eggs laid
* frass produced
* die-off
* feed
* water
* energy
* temperature
* humidity

Other figures that will be added include:

* sales (customer, product, amount, price, profit)

## Presentation
Data is presented in graphs/charts separated by category, with adjustable time period displays. Table readouts are also available.

## Hardware Integration
Hardware components for automatically tracking and publishing climate (temperature and humidity) data are an optional addition. Integrated scales for measuring and publishing other volumes will be added at a later date.

--------------------

## Little Herds Data Pooling Project
[Little Herds](http://www.littleherds.org/) is working on a project for crowd sourced [industry data](http://www.littleherds.org/campaigns-main/ento-data-industry-reports). With their cooperation, data publishing can be integrated into the app, allowing farms to anonymously (if they so choose) contribute their data to the community's industry report effort.

The app may also pull in industry data for comparisons and to create targets/goals (think farm performance compared to market).

## Pilot Farms
[Colony Farm](http://www.colony.farm) will test the app as they build their farm in early 2017. Other small operations will be sought for beta testing in spring 2017.
